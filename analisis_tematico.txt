4. In Colombia, 40% of households already own their homes. Of this total, 35.4% have completed payment, and 4.1% are still in the process. The growth of the real estate sector has caused difficulties in achieving this goal. Subsidies for housing are presented as a solution for millions of people across the country. Family compensation boxes offer economic support intended for the acquisition, construction, or improvement of real estate, particularly for those within the family compensation system. In 2021, subsidies were adjusted based on the minimum wage (1'423.500). Households with incomes up to 2 SMMLV can receive a maximum subsidy of 30 salaries, and households with incomes between 2 and 4 SMMLV can receive a subsidy of up to 20 salaries minimum. Requirements for applying for the subsidy include being affiliated with a family compensation box, having a combined income that does not exceed 4 SMMLV, not owning property within the national territory, and not having previously received housing subsidies. To apply for the subsidy, the request must be filed with the corresponding family compensation box, including all required documents. The application is then reviewed to determine if it meets the requirements and if there are available resources, managed by the family compensation box. Once approved, the subsidy can be used to purchase, construct, or improve a social interest housing (VIS).
